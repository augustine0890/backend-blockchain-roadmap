# Algorithms and Time Space Complexity
- Big O is a way to categorize your algorithms time or memory requirements based on input.
- Growth is with respect to the input
- Constants are dropped
- Worst case is usually the way we measure

# Arrays
- They are fixed size, continiguous memory chunks.
  - Cannot grow it
  - Array reallocation: allocate a new, larger array --> copy the contents of the old array into the new array --> free the old array.
