# Bitcoin
- Blockchain is about enabling peer-to-peer transactions in a decentralized network
- Validation, Verification, Immutable Recording, and Consensus lead to Trust and Security.

# Blockchain Structure
- A block is composed of a header of information about the block and a set of valid transactions.
- Blockchain was created to support security and trust in a decentralized trustless environment of the cryptocurrency
- UTXO: Unspent Transaction Output. A transaction generates new UTXOs for transferring the amount specified in the input UTXOs.
- Miners are computers that excute operations (software) defined by the blockchain protocol

# Basic Operations
- The algorithm for consensus in the Bitcoin blockchain is Proof of Work (protocol). It gets its name because it involves "work" or computational power to solve the puzzle and to claim the right to form the next block.
- Miners take on added work or computation to verify transactions, broadcast transactions, compete to claim the right to create a block, work on reaching consensus by validating the block, broadcasting the newly created block and confirming transactions.
- Miners are computers that validate and process blockchain transactions and solve the cryptographic puzzle to add new blocks
