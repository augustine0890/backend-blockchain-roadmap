# React Web Dev 101
## Environment
- Checklist:
  - Install Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  - Install node.js and npm (https://nodejs.org/)
- Test your installation by running Visual Studio Code:
  - Open the terminal (Terminal > New Terminal menu)
  - Type the following in the terminal:
  `node -v`
  `npm -v`
  - After each line, you should see the corresponding version appear in the terminal.
  - In case there is an error, close and re-open your Visual Studio Code so that the installation of node.js is taken into consideration.

## First React App
- Running React Code in the Browser
  - Visit https://reactjs.org/ and try out the examples. Don’t have high expectations towards understanding what’s going on, just play with the code.
  - Download a simple HTML file that contains React from https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html. Run the code in the browser.
